## start instance
This program will start a VM instance on OpenStack at UPPMAX. In order to run the program one must run a Runtime Configuration (RC) from OpenStack with "source config-file"

TODO: Setup the instance in a proper way. These could be used for both a server and a client.

If we're skipping Ansible:
TODO: Create two cloud-init file, one for setting up a server-VM and one for setting up a client-VM and install all pre-requisites
